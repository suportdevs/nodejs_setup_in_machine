# Download the install script
# Using curl, or wget, download the installation script. In the URL below make sure you replace v12.0.0 with the latest version of nvm.

=> curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.0/install.sh -o install_nvm.sh

# Run the install script with bash.

=> bash install_nvm.sh

# This script clones the nvm repository into ~/.nvm. Then it updates your profile (~/.bash_profile, ~/.zshrc, ~/.profile, or ~/.bashrc) to source the nvm.sh it contains.

# You can confirm that your profile is updated by looking at the install script's output to determine which file it used. Look for something like the following in that file:

=> export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
  [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
  [ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion
  
  
#Restart your terminal
#In order to pick up the changes to your profile either close and reopen the terminal, or manually source your respective ~/.profile.

#Example:

=> source ~/.bash_profile

#Verify it worked
#Finally, you can verify that it's installed with the command command:

=> command -v nvm

# See what it does
# Finally, run the nvm command to get a list of all the available sub-commands and to further verify that installation worked.

# Use nvm to install the latest LTS release of Node.js
# Now that you've got nvm installed let's use it to install, and use, the current LTS version of Node.js.

=> nvm install --lts

# Output
# Installing latest LTS version.
